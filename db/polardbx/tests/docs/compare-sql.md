Below is a side-by-side comparison of the two examples—one using Apache Calcite “directly” and one using PolarDBX’s fork (or heavily customized version) of Calcite. We’ll look at how each example sets up the query environment, how they parse/validate/convert SQL to relational algebra (RelNode), and the general level of difficulty and abstraction each approach exposes.

------

## 1. High-Level Purpose and Flow

### CalciteSimpleExample (Pure Apache Calcite)

1. **Create a Schema**
   - Uses `Frameworks.createRootSchema(true)` to build a root schema.
   - Adds a `SimpleTable` (implementing `ScannableTable`) under the name `USERS`.
2. **Set up Parser/Planner**
   - Builds a `FrameworkConfig` with parser configuration (`SqlParser.config().withCaseSensitive(false)`).
   - Creates a `Planner` instance via `Frameworks.getPlanner(config)`.
3. **Parse, Validate, Convert**
   - For each query string:
     1. **Parse** the SQL into a `SqlNode` (using Calcite’s default parser).
     2. **Validate** the `SqlNode`.
     3. **RelNode Conversion**: `planner.rel(validate).project()`—this produces a `RelNode`.
     4. **Explain** the plan using `RelNode.explain()`.
4. **Run in a loop**
   - Demonstrates multiple queries, closing and re-creating the `Planner` each time.

### PolarDBX Example (Using PolarDBX Fork of Calcite)

1. **Configure the Execution Context**
   - Sets `ConfigDataMode` to `MOCK` and the instance role to `FAST_MOCK`.
   - Creates an `ExecutionContext` with a custom schema name (e.g., `"teste"`).
2. **Schema Manager and Table Metadata**
   - Creates a `TestSchemaManager`, initializes it, and adds table definitions (`TableMeta` with columns like `Host`, `User`, etc.).
   - Uses specialized classes like `ColumnMeta`, `Field`, `TableMeta`, and `StatisticManager`.
3. **Parser**
   - Uses `FastsqlParser` (a customized parser under the PolarDBX ecosystem).
   - Parses the input SQL into a `SqlNodeList`.
4. **Validation and Conversion**
   - Creates a `SqlConverter` (PolarDBX’s wrapper around Calcite’s validator and planner).
   - Calls `converter.validate(ast)` to get a validated `SqlNode`.
   - Creates a `PlannerContext`, then calls `converter.toRel(validatedNode, plannerContext)` to get the `RelNode`.
5. **Explain Plan**
   - Uses `relNode.explain(new RelWriterImpl(printWriter))` to show the final plan.

## 2. Abstractions Used

### CalciteSimpleExample

- **SchemaPlus / AbstractTable / ScannableTable**
  - Straight from the core Calcite APIs.
  - You define your own table by implementing `ScannableTable`, returning an `Enumerable` of rows.
  - This is the standard approach in Calcite for an in-memory or custom data source.
- **Planner, SqlParser, SqlNode, RelNode**
  - Uses Calcite’s default building blocks for query planning.
  - Minimal additional layers.
- **Frameworks**
  - Calcite’s recommended mechanism (`Frameworks.newConfigBuilder()`) to assemble parser, validator, and planner configurations.

### PolarDBX Example

- **ExecutionContext**
  - A PolarDBX concept that wraps details of the current schema, session variables, etc.
- **TestSchemaManager** / **TableMeta** / **ColumnMeta** / **StatisticManager**
  - Classes that handle schema definitions, statistics, and metadata in PolarDBX.
  - Provide additional functionality such as distributed table management, indexes, table status, etc.
- **FastsqlParser**
  - PolarDBX’s specialized parser instead of Calcite’s default parser.
  - Under the hood, still produces an AST that’s convertible into Calcite `SqlNode`.
- **SqlConverter**
  - A higher-level wrapper around Calcite’s validation and relational conversion, integrated with PolarDBX’s environment and rules.
- **PlannerContext**
  - Another PolarDBX concept that ties together execution parameters, schema info, and optimization rules for generating physical plans.

## 3. Levels of Difficulty and Complexity

### Using Pure Apache Calcite

- Learning Curve

  :

  - You need to understand the basics of Calcite’s core concepts: schemas, tables, planners, and relational algebra.
  - Once you grasp these, a small example can be set up fairly quickly.

- Configuration

  :

  - Typically less config overhead.
  - The example is quite direct: create table → parse → validate → plan → explain.

- Extensibility

  :

  - If you want advanced features (materialized views, advanced optimizations, or distributed execution), you’ll need to implement or configure them yourself or integrate with other frameworks.

### Using PolarDBX (Forked Calcite)

- Learning Curve

  :

  - You need to understand both the Calcite concepts *and* the additional classes/layers from PolarDBX (like `OptimizerContext`, `ExecutionContext`, `SqlConverter`, etc.).
  - There are more moving parts, especially if you’re setting up the environment from scratch.

- Configuration

  :

  - PolarDBX is designed as an entire ecosystem for distributed or scale-out SQL, so you get advanced features (e.g., sharding, distributed transactions, stats-based optimization) “baked in.”
  - This means you have to configure schema managers, statistic managers, and so on.

- Extensibility

  :

  - PolarDBX focuses on large-scale or cloud deployments.
  - If you’re building something that needs distributed queries, cluster-based optimization, etc., the forked version might offer features that pure Calcite doesn’t provide out-of-the-box.

## 4. For a User with Little Background Knowledge

1. **What Are They?**
   - **Apache Calcite** is a framework for parsing, validating, and optimizing SQL queries. It’s not a database; it’s more a “query planner and optimizer library” that you can embed in your own system.
   - **PolarDBX** is Alibaba’s (and now open-sourced by [Aliyun/Alibaba Cloud]) distributed SQL engine that uses a *forked or customized Calcite* under the hood to handle complex distributed scenarios.
2. **When to Use Which?**
   - If you just need an embedded SQL parser/optimizer or want to experiment with building your own query engine for small to medium complexity, **pure Apache Calcite** is simpler to get started with.
   - If you want the environment of a distributed SQL engine that can handle large scale, and you’re okay with working in the PolarDBX ecosystem (plus you want features like sharding or multi-table distribution built-in), **PolarDBX** (and its fork of Calcite) might be more suitable.
3. **Complexity vs. Power**
   - **Calcite** alone: More minimal, easier for a small-scale project, but requires more “DIY” for enterprise or distributed features.
   - **PolarDBX**: Heavier, with more steps to set up, but has advanced capabilities (schema management, distributed optimization, statistics, etc.).

------

## 5. Summary

- **Apache Calcite Example**
  - Very straightforward. You directly see the main Calcite classes (e.g., `Planner`, `SqlParser`, `ScannableTable`).
  - Good if you want a minimal, highly transparent approach to understanding Calcite’s basics.
- **PolarDBX Example**
  - Builds on Calcite but adds a specialized environment.
  - You see classes like `OptimizerContext`, `SqlConverter`, and `FastsqlParser`, which are part of PolarDBX.
  - Allows you to integrate additional functionalities like schema managers, statistic managers, and distributed execution contexts.

In essence, both examples end up at the same fundamental steps (parse → validate → convert to RelNode → produce execution plan). However, PolarDBX wraps these steps in additional layers that handle distributed metadata and advanced optimization strategies. For someone who just wants to learn Calcite’s internals, the **pure Calcite** approach is usually the best starting point. If, on the other hand, you’re aiming for a robust, production-grade distributed SQL environment, you’d look into how PolarDBX extends Calcite to fit those enterprise needs.
