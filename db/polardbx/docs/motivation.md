**Background and Motivation**:  
The current environment relies on MySQL replicas for handling complex analytical queries. While this approach works to some extent, it often falls short in terms of performance for more demanding analytical workloads. Exploring alternative database systems—such as PostgreSQL, TiDB, Doris, or DuckDB—has shown that faster query execution is achievable, but introducing these technologies typically increases operational complexity. Synchronizing data across heterogeneous systems and managing additional components like CDC pipelines can become cumbersome. Any breakdown in these pipelines can lead to service disruptions and lengthy resynchronization, ultimately affecting user satisfaction.

**Inspiration from PolarDB-X**:  
PolarDB-X is a distributed database system that retains a MySQL-compatible interface but significantly enhances query processing capabilities. It introduces advanced SQL parsing, query optimization, and distributed execution while still remaining in the broader MySQL ecosystem. Although PolarDB-X itself is designed for distributed scenarios, its SQL engine components offer interesting potential benefits for improving query performance even when not fully distributing the data.

**Proposed Architectural Approach**:  
The approach involves selectively extracting and leveraging the SQL engine components from PolarDB-X (often referred to as “polardbx-sql”) and integrating them into a new Java-based project. Instead of directly modifying the polardbx-sql source code, the process focuses on incorporating only the necessary functionality to improve query processing. If essential modifications are required, they will be managed through a dedicated fork of the polardbx-sql module.

On the storage side, rather than using a complex distributed engine, the plan is to connect these extracted SQL components to a simplified backend—such as a Percona-based MySQL fork. This maintains a familiar operational environment and leverages existing MySQL replication for data synchronization, reducing complexity compared to introducing entirely new database technologies and data pipelines.

**Key Advantages**:

1.  **Enhanced Query Performance**:  
    By adopting the advanced query parsing and optimization features originally intended for a distributed environment, the system can potentially accelerate complex analytical queries on standard MySQL replicas.
    
2.  **Reduced Operational Complexity**:  
    Staying within the MySQL ecosystem avoids the overhead of managing separate data synchronization frameworks, minimizing the risk of downtime and lengthy resynchronization periods. Standard MySQL replication ensures continuous data flow with fewer moving parts.
    
3.  **Incremental Integration**:  
    The Java-based integration allows for gradual adoption of the polardbx-sql components. Features can be added step by step, thoroughly tested, and validated before broader deployment.
    
4. **Preservation of Native MySQL Semantics**:
    By leveraging the existing MySQL engine as the storage layer, the architecture naturally inherits MySQL’s handling of foreign-key cascading operations (such as ON UPDATE and ON DELETE). In previous attempts with other frameworks, these cascades often posed a replication challenge because they do not appear in the binary logs. By retaining the native MySQL engine and integrating polardbx-sql on top, the system ensures that foreign-key cascades are captured and propagated as intended. This maintains data integrity and significantly reduces the complexity of implementing custom logic or additional replication layers.

**Challenges and Considerations**:

1.  **Compatibility and Maintenance**:  
    Extracting and adapting polardbx-sql components outside of their original distributed context may introduce compatibility issues. Ongoing maintenance efforts, including patching and updating the integrated code, will be required.
     
2.  **Performance Validation and Testing**:  
    While the polardbx-sql engine is designed for distributed execution, it remains an assumption that these query optimization benefits will translate effectively to a non-distributed setup. Rigorous performance testing, benchmarking, and validation will be essential to confirm that the intended improvements are realized.
    
3.  **Development Learning Curve**:  
    The team must gain sufficient understanding of polardbx-sql’s internal architecture. This includes how queries are parsed, optimized, and planned, and how these stages can be integrated smoothly with a single-node or minimally distributed storage engine.
    

**Summary**:  
This project aims to improve analytical query performance on MySQL replicas by integrating advanced SQL parsing and optimization features from polardbx-sql into a custom Java-based solution. By carefully selecting and adapting these components, the system retains the simplicity of MySQL’s operational model while leveraging enhanced query capabilities. However, the approach will require careful consideration of compatibility issues, handling of foreign-key cascading replication, and extensive performance testing. If successful, it offers a promising balance between improved analytics speed and manageable operational complexity.
