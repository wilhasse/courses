# Introduction

High-Level Project Structure Notes:
The PolarDB-X source code (often found in repositories like polardbx-engine or polardbx-sql) is divided into multiple modules. Common top-level packages include:

com.alibaba.polardbx.parser or com.alibaba.polardbx.druid for parsing  
com.alibaba.polardbx.optimizer for logical/physical plan, optimization, and routing  
com.alibaba.polardbx.executor for execution engine and interaction with backend nodes  
com.alibaba.polardbx.server for frontend (protocol) handling and connection management  
Since PolarDB-X leverages a fork of Druid parser and other internal frameworks, you will see many references to druid classes inside the parser and AST handling.

# Steps

## 1. Parsing and AST Construction
Conceptual Step: Convert the SQL text into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Likely Modules/Packages:
com.alibaba.polardbx.druid.sql: Contains a modified/forked Druid SQL parser. Classes like MySqlStatementParser, SQLParser, and SQLExprParser are found here.  
com.alibaba.polardbx.druid.sql.ast: Contains AST node definitions (SQLSelectStatement, SQLSelectQueryBlock, SQLTableSource, SQLExpr nodes, etc.).  
com.alibaba.polardbx.druid.sql.parser: Lexing/tokenization classes and parser entrypoints. 

In Source Code:
Lexing and Parsing: MySqlLexer and MySqlStatementParser (in com.alibaba.polardbx.druid.sql.parser) break down the SQL string.  
AST Nodes: Classes in com.alibaba.polardbx.druid.sql.ast represent each SQL construct. After parsing, you’ll have a tree of these SQLAstNode objects.

## 2. SQL Validation and Semantic Analysis

Conceptual Step: Validate table names, column references, and basic semantics.

Likely Modules/Packages:
com.alibaba.polardbx.optimizer.parse: Contains logic to transform the Druid AST into PolarDB-X’s internal representation.  
com.alibaba.polardbx.optimizer.core.expression: Used for representing and validating expressions in a more engine-friendly way.

In Source Code:
The frontend transforms Druid’s AST into an internal SQLNode representation (if used), and checks schema information from the metadata manager.

## 3. Logical Plan Construction

Conceptual Step: Transform the AST into a logical plan (a tree of relational operators).

Likely Modules/Packages:
com.alibaba.polardbx.optimizer.core.rel: Classes representing relational operators (logical operators like LogicalView, LogicalProject, LogicalFilter, etc.).  
com.alibaba.polardbx.optimizer.core: Core planning utilities.

In Source Code:
There may be builder classes that traverse the AST and produce a logical plan (e.g., AstToRelConverter-like classes).  
You’ll find logical operators such as LogicalView for table scans, LogicalFilter for WHERE conditions, etc.

## 4. Optimization

Conceptual Step: Apply rule-based and/or cost-based optimizations, choose indexes, rewrite conditions.

Likely Modules/Packages:
com.alibaba.polardbx.optimizer.core.planner: Core optimization framework, possibly including rules to optimize logical plans.  
com.alibaba.polardbx.optimizer.config: Optimization configuration and rule sets.

In Source Code:
Optimizer rules (like pushing down filters, choosing indexes) are often found in ...core.planner.rule sub-packages.  
Classes that implement optimization passes might have names like RuleManager, LogicalPlanOptimizer, or PlannerContext.

## 5. Routing Decision
Conceptual Step: Determine which backend (or shard) to send the query to. For a non-distributed scenario, this step is simple.

Likely Modules/Packages:
com.alibaba.polardbx.optimizer.rule: Contains logic for table routing and shard calculation.  
com.alibaba.polardbx.optimizer.context: Holds execution context, including routing context.  
com.alibaba.polardbx.executor.utils: Utilities to help pick connections/nodes.  

In Source Code:
Look for classes like TableRule, RouteManager, or PartitionPruner which decide where the data lives.  
Even if you have a single-node scenario, the routing module is where the final determination of “which physical schema” happens.

## 6. Physical Plan Generation
Conceptual Step: Convert the optimized logical plan into a physical execution plan or direct SQL statements to send to the backend.

Likely Modules/Packages:
com.alibaba.polardbx.optimizer.core.rel2plan: Classes that convert from logical plan objects to executable/physical plans.  
com.alibaba.polardbx.optimizer.core.planner: Physical planning might also occur here, integrated with optimization steps.  

In Source Code:
Classes might be named RelToPhysicalPlanConverter or similar. They take a LogicalView or LogicalTableScan and produce the final SQL string or a structure representing the physical plan operations.

## 7. Execution and Sending to Backend

Conceptual Step: Execute the final plan, sending SQL to the MySQL-fork backend and retrieving results.

Likely Modules/Packages:
com.alibaba.polardbx.executor: Core execution framework.  
com.alibaba.polardbx.executor.cursor: Result cursors and iteration over result sets.  
com.alibaba.polardbx.executor.spi: Execution service provider interfaces.  
com.alibaba.polardbx.executor.mpp: MPP execution engine for distributed queries, but for a simple scenario, this might not be involved.  

In Source Code:
There will be classes that represent a physical execution node, something like PhyTableScan or PhyQueryOperation.
The executor sends the final SQL to the backend node, often using a connection/pool manager. Check com.alibaba.polardbx.executor.utils.ExecUtils or ...executor.handler classes that handle sending commands.

## 8. Result Handling and Return to Client
Conceptual Step: Receive data from the backend, possibly merge or transform, and return it to the client.

Likely Modules/Packages:
com.alibaba.polardbx.executor.cursor: Classes like ResultCursor or ArrayResultCursor handle result sets.  
com.alibaba.polardbx.server: For the final leg, communicating results to the client using the MySQL protocol.

In Source Code:
For a simple scenario, the ResultCursor returned by the backend execution is directly sent to the client.  
Classes named ServerConnection, FrontendCommandHandler, or FrontendResultSet process and send rows over the network protocol.

## 9. Protocol Layer

Conceptual Step: The MySQL frontend protocol server that the client connects to.

Likely Modules/Packages:
com.alibaba.polardbx.server: The networking layer that speaks MySQL protocol with the client.  
com.alibaba.polardbx.net: Might contain low-level protocol handling code.

In Source Code:
ServerConnection handles a single client connection.  
CommandHandler processes SQL commands from the client.  
MySQLPacket classes represent low-level protocol packets sent to/from the client.    

Summary of Key Packages:
Parsing (Druid Integration): com.alibaba.polardbx.druid.sql.*  
AST-to-Logical Plan: com.alibaba.polardbx.optimizer.core.rel, com.alibaba.polardbx.optimizer.parse

By following the flow described above and searching for these packages and class names in the codebase, you will be able to pinpoint how each step is handled within PolarDB-X’s Java code modules. This mapping should help you navigate the source code and understand the lifecycle of a query as it moves through the system.
