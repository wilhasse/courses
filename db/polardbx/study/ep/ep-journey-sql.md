## The Journey of a SQL Query

**High-level steps** in a distributed SQL engine:

1. **Parsing**
2. **Logical Plan Generation**
3. **Logical Optimization**
4. **Physical Plan Generation**
5. **Physical Optimization & Execution**
6. **Result Merging** (if multiple shards or parallel slices)

Let’s break it down more clearly, with **simple analogies** and **short examples**.

------

## 2. Parsing: From Text to AST

### The Task

You write:

```
sqlCopiar códigoSELECT name, age
FROM users
WHERE city = 'New York' AND age >= 18
ORDER BY age;
```

- The **parser** reads this **SQL string** and checks it for **syntactic correctness**.
- It builds an **AST** (Abstract Syntax Tree), a tree-like data structure that represents the query logically (e.g., *“a SELECT statement that has a WHERE, an ORDER BY, etc.”*).

### An Analogy

Think of **parsing** like turning an **English sentence** into a **grammar tree**. For example, in grammar school, we break a sentence into subject, verb, objects, etc. Similarly, an SQL parser breaks your query into the main “SELECT” node, which has sub-nodes for columns, table references, conditions, etc.

### Example AST (simplified)

```
vbnetCopiar códigoSelect
 ├─ Columns: [name, age]
 ├─ From: users
 ├─ Where:
 │    ├─ city = 'New York'
 │    └─ age >= 18
 └─ Order By: age
```

This is **not** yet optimized or distributed—just a **structural** representation.

------

## 3. Logical Plan Generation

### The Task

- The parsed AST is **translated** into a **logical plan** (often using a framework like Calcite).
- A **logical plan** is essentially a **tree** of **relational algebra operators** (e.g., `LogicalTableScan`, `LogicalFilter`, `LogicalProject`, `LogicalSort`, etc.).

### An Analogy

Imagine a “blueprint” for how data flows. The plan states:

1. “Scan the table called `users`.”
2. “Filter rows where city='New York' and age≥18.”
3. “Project columns `name` and `age`.”
4. “Sort by age.”

But at this **logical** level, we **haven’t decided** how to physically execute it (no specific indexes or partition info). The system just says, *"Here is the abstract pipeline of operations."*

### Example Logical Plan

```
lessCopiar códigoLogicalSort (by age)
 └─ LogicalProject (fields: name, age)
     └─ LogicalFilter (conditions: city='New York', age>=18)
         └─ LogicalTableScan (table: users)
```

No mention of which node or which partition. Just the **logical** steps.

------

## 4. Logical Optimization

### The Task

- The **logical plan** might get **rules** applied: push down filters closer to table scans, combine projections, rewrite subqueries, etc.
- The engine tries to simplify or rearrange the plan for efficiency **without** choosing exact physical details yet.

### Example

- If you had a subquery `WHERE city IN (SELECT ... )`, maybe it rewrites it as a join or a “semi-join.”
- If you had a `WHERE` after a `PROJECT`, it might push that `WHERE` down to occur **before** the projection to reduce data volume.

**After** these transformations, you still have a *logical plan*, but it might be simpler or more efficient logically.

------

## 5. Physical Plan Generation

### The Task

- The logical plan is **converted** into a **physical plan**.
- For **PolarDB-X** or a distributed engine, this step involves deciding **which node** or **which partition** (or both) to query, **which indexes** to use, etc.

### In a Sharded or Partitioned Database

If the table `users` is split across multiple shards (by user ID, for example), the optimizer might decide:

- “We only need shard #3 if city='New York' lines up with certain partition constraints” (assuming advanced pruning).
- Or maybe “We must query shards #2 and #4 in parallel, then merge.”

### In a Single Node or Replicated Environment

- The **physical plan** might simply say: “Use index on `city`, then do a range scan on age≥18, and sort by `age`.”
- Or if you have multiple replicas, the plan might say: “Split the ID range across replicas for parallel reads.”

### An Analogy

Think of the **physical plan** as a **detailed itinerary** for a road trip. You know each road you’ll take, the order in which you’ll drive them, any tolls you’ll pay, etc. The **logical plan** was just “I want to travel from point A to point B via highways,” but the **physical plan** is “Take highway I-80 from exit 32 to exit 55, then switch to route 101...”.

### Example Physical Plan

```
sqlCopiar códigoPhysSort (algorithm: external sort)
 └─ PhysFilter (executed at ShardGroup#2, condition city='New York' and age>=18)
     └─ PhysIndexScan (table=users, index=city_idx)   <---- physically using "city_idx"
```

Or multiple subplans if we have 2 shards:

```
sqlCopiar códigoUnion
 ├─ SubPlan 1:  (Scan shard #2, filter city='New York', age>=18, project [name, age])
 └─ SubPlan 2:  (Scan shard #3, filter city='New York', age>=18, project [name, age])
```

Then the engine merges them.

------

## 6. Physical Optimization & Execution

### The Task

- Once a physical plan is decided, the engine might do final **cost-based** tweaks (choosing which index to use, in which order to do merges, etc.).
- Then it executes the plan. In PolarDB-X:
  1. It sends sub-queries to each relevant shard or replica.
  2. **Pushes** as many operations as possible to the shard (for example, `WHERE` conditions or partial aggregations).
  3. Receives partial results.
  4. Merges them, sorts them if needed, and returns the final result set to the user.

### Example

If the plan was multiple shards:

1. Sub-query: `SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE city='New York' AND age>=18 ORDER BY age` on shard #2
2. Sub-query: `SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE city='New York' AND age>=18 ORDER BY age` on shard #3
3. The coordinator merges these two sorted streams (like merging two sorted lists).

------

## 7. Visualizing End-to-End with a **Concrete Example**

Imagine you have a table `users` partitioned by **user_id** across two shards:

- **Shard A**: user IDs from 1 to 50,000
- **Shard B**: user IDs from 50,001 to 100,000

You issue a query:

```
sqlCopiar códigoSELECT city, COUNT(*) AS num_users
FROM users
WHERE age > 30
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY num_users DESC;
```

Here’s the step-by-step:

1. **Parsing**:

   - The parser checks syntax and builds an AST.
   - The AST sees columns `[city, COUNT(*), age]`, from `users`, with a group by city, where `age>30`.

2. **Logical Plan**:

   - The system constructs something like:

     ```
     sqlCopiar códigoLogicalSort (sort by num_users DESC)
       └─ LogicalAggregate (group by city, agg = COUNT(*))
           └─ LogicalFilter (condition = age>30)
               └─ LogicalTableScan (table=users)
     ```

3. **Logical Optimization**:

   - If possible, it might push the `WHERE age>30` closer to the table scan.
   - Possibly it stays about the same.

4. **Physical Plan**:

   - The engine sees `users` is partitioned across **Shard A** and **Shard B**.
   - It creates two sub-plans (one for each shard):
     - Sub-plan A: filter `age>30`, group by `city`, then partial aggregator “COUNT(*)”.
     - Sub-plan B: the same, on shard B.
   - Then a final aggregator on the coordinator merges these two partial group-by results into a single “(city, num_users).”

   So effectively:

   ```
   scssCopiar códigoUNION ALL
   ├─ SubPlan(A):
   │    └─ PhyAgg (GroupBy=city, Agg=COUNT(*)) [executed on Shard A]
   │         └─ PhyFilter(age>30)
   │              └─ PhyTableScan(users)
   └─ SubPlan(B):
        └─ PhyAgg (GroupBy=city, Agg=COUNT(*)) [executed on Shard B]
             └─ PhyFilter(age>30)
                  └─ PhyTableScan(users)
   
   Then => Final Agg on coordinator merges partial aggregates from (A) and (B).
   Then => Sort by num_users desc
   ```

5. **Execution**:

   - The engine sends the query “`SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE age>30 GROUP BY city`” to shard A.
   - Similarly to shard B.
   - Each shard returns rows like `[('New York', 1234), ('LA', 999), ...]`.
   - The coordinator merges them: if `'New York'` appears in both sub-results, it sums the counts.
   - Finally, it sorts by `num_users DESC` and returns the result set to the user.

------

## 8. Why This Matters

- **Performance**: Pushing filters/aggregates down means less data travels over the network.
- **Scalability**: By parallelizing across multiple shards or nodes, the engine can handle bigger data sets quickly.
- **Maintainability**: Splitting the steps (parse, logical plan, physical plan) keeps the system modular and easier to evolve.

------

## 9. Key Terminology Summaries

1. **AST** (Abstract Syntax Tree)
   A tree of SQL keywords and clauses. Example: “Select Node → From Node → Where Node → Columns Node,” etc.
2. **Logical Plan**
   A *relational algebra* representation: operators like `Filter`, `Project`, `Join`, `Aggregate` arranged in a tree. No detail yet about specific indexes, partitions, etc.
3. **Physical Plan**
   Adds actual **execution details**: which shard(s) to read from, which index to use, how to do partial aggregation, etc.
4. **Pushdown**
   The process of letting the underlying shard or replica do part of the work (like filtering or aggregating) so the coordinator or driver doesn’t do all the heavy lifting.
5. **Sharding** / **Partitioning**
   Splitting large tables across multiple physical nodes.
   E.g., user IDs 1–50k on node A, 50k–100k on node B.
   In contrast, a single node might just do everything locally.

------

## 10. A Step-by-Step “Mental Model”

1. **SQL** is typed into your client.

2. **Parse**: The system checks syntax → builds **AST**.

3. **Logical Plan**: The AST is turned into a **relational** operator tree (like “table scan + filter + group by + project + sort”).

4. **Optimize** the plan logically (merge filters, rewrite subqueries, etc.).

5. **Physical Plan**: The system decides how to map that plan to actual **physical** shards or indexes, generating “sub-queries” or “operators” to run on each node.

6. Execution

   :

   - The coordinator sends sub-queries to the shards.
   - Each shard returns partial results.
   - The coordinator merges them, does final sorts/aggregates if needed, and returns the final row set to the user.

------

### Final Note

This **layered design** is standard in modern SQL engines like **PolarDB-X, Apache Calcite-based systems,** etc. Understanding each step helps you know **where** performance optimizations happen and how queries are actually run behind the scenes.

**I hope this step-by-step explanation, with examples and analogies, clarifies how \**logical\** and \**physical\** plans fit into the big picture of a distributed SQL engine like PolarDB-X!**
