**Overview of Alibaba Canal**

Alibaba Canal is an open-source system created by Alibaba to track and parse [MySQL Binlog](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/binlog-event.html) events. It behaves like a “Binlog capture” system, forwarding database changes (in real time) to consumers (clients). In essence:

1. **MySQL** produces binlog events whenever data changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.).
2. **Canal Server** acts as a simulated MySQL slave, connecting to the MySQL primary database and continuously reading its binlog events.
3. **Canal Client** (like in the code example) connects to the Canal Server and retrieves these binlog events through Canal’s own protocol.
4. **Canal Protocol** is a custom serialization and transport layer that packages binlog events with extra metadata so that clients can parse them easily.

Below is a breakdown of how the **Canal Server** and the **Canal Client** communicate:

## 1. Canal Server Internals

1. **Connecting to MySQL as a Slave**  
   - Canal Server acts like a MySQL slave. It initiates a connection to MySQL using the standard MySQL replication protocol (i.e., `CHANGE MASTER TO ...; START SLAVE;`-like behavior, but programmatically).  
   - This means the server logs in with replication credentials and tells MySQL, “I want to read the binlog from position X in file Y.”

2. **Reading Binlog Events**  
   - MySQL sends binlog events to any connected slave. These events are low-level row-based or statement-based replication logs.  
   - Canal Server continuously receives these events and buffers them.

3. **Parsing & Transforming**  
   - Canal translates (parses) the raw binlog events into a more structured, row-based format (the **`CanalEntry`** messages, typically using [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)).  
   - Each event is converted to a `RowChange` object containing the before and after images of the changed rows, plus metadata like schema name, table name, and event type (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

4. **Serving Binlog Data**  
   - Canal Server stores these transformed messages in memory (or potentially in a queue).  
   - When a Canal Client connects (as in the sample code you shared), the Canal Server delivers these structured messages to the client using Canal’s custom protocol.

## 2. Canal Client Communication Flow

1. **Connect to Canal Server**  
   - The client uses `CanalConnectors.newSingleConnector(...)` (or other connector types if there is a cluster setup).  
   - This establishes a TCP connection between the client and Canal Server.

2. **Specify Destination / Subscription**  
   - When you call `connector.connect()` and `connector.subscribe(".*\\..*")`, you are telling the server which databases or tables you’re interested in.  
   - `connector.subscribe(".*\\..*")` means “Subscribe to everything in every schema and table.”

3. **Polling for Messages**  
   - The client calls methods like `connector.getWithoutAck(batchSize)` or `connector.get(batchSize)`.  
   - The request is sent over the TCP connection using Canal’s **protocol buffer**-based format or a Netty-based transport.  
   - The Canal Server responds with a `Message` object that contains a list of `Entry` items.

4. **Acknowledge (ACK) / Rollback**  
   - Once the client receives a batch of messages, it processes them (e.g., logs them, updates a search index, etc.).  
   - If processing is successful, it calls `connector.ack(batchId)`.  
   - If processing fails, it can call `connector.rollback(batchId)` so the server resends (or re-delivers) those messages later.

## 3. About the “Custom Protocol”

- **Why a Custom Protocol?**  
  MySQL binlog data itself is fairly low-level. Alibaba Canal normalizes it by offering a convenient object model (via Protocol Buffers). This hides a lot of complexity of raw binlog events and provides additional features (e.g., easy parsing of row columns).

- **Data Format**  
  - **Transport**: Typically uses TCP (with Netty in many versions) to push data from server to client.  
  - **Serialization**: Canal uses Google Protocol Buffers (`.proto` files) to define `Entry`, `RowData`, `RowChange`, etc. So the actual bytes on the wire are in Protobuf format.  
  - **Batching**: The canal protocol can batch multiple binlog events together into a single **`Message`** (the `batchSize` can be configured).

- **Protocol Buffers**  
  Protocol Buffers is a language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. With `.proto` definitions, you can generate Java objects (or objects in other languages) that match the binlog event structure. Alibaba Canal uses these generated classes in the client and server so they can easily encode/decode events.

```

1. **CanalServer** connects to MySQL using the replication protocol (like a slave).
2. **MySQL** sends binlog events to CanalServer.
3. **CanalClient** connects to CanalServer (over TCP) using the Canal protocol.
4. The client periodically requests new messages (`connector.getWithoutAck(batchSize)`).
5. The CanalServer sends `Message` objects containing a list of binlog `Entry`s (serialized via Protocol Buffers).
6. The client processes them and either **ACK**s or **rolls back**.

## 5. Summary

- **Alibaba Canal** is basically a specialized “binlog streaming proxy”:
  - It **mimics** a MySQL slave to **pull** binlog data from MySQL.
  - It **decodes** raw binlog events into a more structured format (Protobuf).
  - It **serves** these decoded events to client applications through a custom protocol.

- **Why is this useful?**  
  It decouples the logic of handling raw binlog events from downstream consumers. Multiple clients can connect to Canal and subscribe to real-time changes, each with different offsets (positions). This is especially helpful for building near real-time data pipelines—e.g., synchronizing data to Elasticsearch, building caches, or creating a CDC (Change Data Capture) pipeline.

In short, **the Canal protocol** is a small layer of abstraction on top of MySQL binlog replication. The client library (like in the example code) automatically handles connecting, subscribing, fetching, and decoding the binlog events. The developer simply processes the resulting row change events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.).
