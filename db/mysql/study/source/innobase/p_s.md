Below are detailed explanations of the provided C++ header (`p_s.h`) and source (`p_s.cc`) files. These files are related to the InnoDB storage engine's interface with the Performance Schema (P_S) tables that expose information about data locks and lock waits within InnoDB.

### Overall Purpose

The MySQL Performance Schema (P_S) can track various internal instrumentation points, including those related to InnoDB locks. The classes and functions in these files implement special iterators that the Performance Schema uses to populate its `performance_schema.data_locks` and `performance_schema.data_lock_waits` tables with information extracted from InnoDB's internal data structures.

In other words, when a user queries these P_S tables, MySQL uses these iterators to scan InnoDB’s internal lock data and return rows describing each lock or lock wait currently happening. This includes lock owners, lock modes, transaction IDs, thread IDs, and so forth.

### The Header File (`p_s.h`)

#### Key Points:

- The header defines a class `Innodb_data_lock_inspector` which implements the `PSI_engine_data_lock_inspector` interface. This interface is part of MySQL’s plugin API for Performance Schema. By providing an implementation, InnoDB integrates its internal lock information into the Performance Schema tables.

- The `Innodb_data_lock_inspector` class has methods:

  - `create_data_lock_iterator()`
  - `create_data_lock_wait_iterator()`
  - `destroy_data_lock_iterator()`
  - `destroy_data_lock_wait_iterator()`

  These methods create and destroy iterators that P_S uses to inspect InnoDB locks and lock waits.

- The inspector is essentially a bridge: Performance Schema uses it to gain access to engine-specific lock data.

### The Source File (`p_s.cc`)

#### High-Level Overview:

The source file provides the actual implementations of:

- `Innodb_data_lock_iterator`
- `Innodb_data_lock_wait_iterator`

These classes implement scanning of InnoDB’s internal lock structures. They must carefully handle concurrency and avoid holding global locks for too long. The code ensures that only manageable chunks of lock data are processed at a time to avoid freezing InnoDB or causing performance regressions.

#### Detailed Components:

1. **Innodb_data_lock_iterator**
   This iterator is responsible for enumerating all currently held data locks in InnoDB. When Performance Schema queries `data_locks`, it creates an instance of this iterator. The iterator scans through InnoDB’s lock system, chunk by chunk, producing rows that correspond to each lock in InnoDB.

   Key points:

   - `scan()` method: Iterates over InnoDB locks, adding them to the container that Performance Schema provides. It checks filters (e.g., only certain transaction IDs).
   - `fetch()` method: Given a specific lock ID, it retrieves that particular lock if still present.

   Internally, the iterator:

   - Uses `All_locks_iterator` (an InnoDB internal mechanism) to get batches of locks.
   - Splits locks into two major categories: table-level locks and record-level locks.
   - For each lock, it generates a unique `ENGINE_LOCK_ID` string (using code similar to what INFORMATION_SCHEMA did), and populates fields like lock mode, status, schema, table name, etc.

2. **Innodb_data_lock_wait_iterator**
   This iterator enumerates lock wait situations, i.e., which lock requests are waiting because another transaction holds a conflicting lock. This is used to populate `data_lock_waits`.

   Key points:

   - `scan()` method: Similar to `Innodb_data_lock_iterator::scan()`, but for lock waits.
   - `fetch()` method: Given a pair of lock IDs (requesting and blocking), tries to find that specific wait scenario.

   It works by analyzing "waiting" locks and determining which locks are blocking them. For each wait scenario, it returns details about the requesting lock and the blocking lock.

3. **Lock Identification Strings:**

   In both iterators, locks are identified by a unique string `ENGINE_LOCK_ID`. This is constructed in a way that is backward-compatible with the old `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables. The code uses helper functions like:

   - `print_lock_id()`
   - `print_record_lock_id()`

   to build these unique identifiers.

4. **Filtering and Efficiency:**

   The code places a strong emphasis on not performing a full global scan of all locks at once. Instead, it iterates in batches. This approach avoids holding global locks for too long and also avoids building a giant in-memory snapshot. The process is therefore more incremental and efficient.

   The code comments also discuss different potential approaches and the chosen compromise to balance performance, consistency, and memory usage.

5. **Table and Index Name Parsing:**

   For each lock, the iterator extracts:

   - The schema name
   - The table name
   - The partition and subpartition names (if any)

   This is done by calling `dict_name::get_table()` and `dict_name::get_partition()`. The parsed information is then placed into the P_S container, which takes ownership of the allocated strings.

6. **Data Structures:**

   The code uses:

   - `unordered_map` to cache parsed table paths to avoid redundant parsing.
   - `PSI_server_data_lock_container` and `PSI_server_data_lock_wait_container` abstractions provided by P_S, which define how to store and retrieve instrumentation data.

7. **Lock Modes, Types, and Status:**

   The code provides strings like "GRANTED" or "WAITING" for the lock status and extracts lock modes (e.g., "X", "S", etc.) and lock types (e.g., "RECORD", "TABLE").

8. **Integration with P_S:**

   The final result of all these iterators is that Performance Schema tables `data_locks` and `data_lock_waits` get populated with current InnoDB lock state each time they are queried. P_S sets the filters (like which transaction IDs to show), and the iterator respects these filters.

   The `add_lock_row()` and `add_lock_wait_row()` methods of the container are where the final data is handed off to Performance Schema.

### Conclusion

The `p_s.h` and `p_s.cc` files provide a critical integration point between InnoDB’s internal lock data structures and the MySQL Performance Schema’s external SQL interface. This allows database administrators to query performance_schema tables and see a real-time snapshot of locks and lock waits inside InnoDB, aiding in performance tuning and troubleshooting.

- **`p_s.h`**: Declares `Innodb_data_lock_inspector` which can produce lock and lock-wait iterators.
- **`p_s.cc`**: Implements the logic for scanning InnoDB locks, building unique lock IDs, parsing table names, respecting filters, and providing results to Performance Schema.

This code is instrumental in giving DBAs insight into lock contention and conflicts at a granular level, helping diagnose problems such as deadlocks, long-running locks, or unexpected contention.
