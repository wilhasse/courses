Below is an in-depth explanation of the provided header and source code files related to a Percona-specific INFORMATION_SCHEMA plugin that exposes InnoDB "read view" information.

### Overall Context

InnoDB uses "read views" to implement multi-versioning and consistent reads. A read view represents a snapshot of the transaction state at a particular point in time, which helps provide consistent queries (using MVCC). It contains information like the current upper and lower transaction ID limits and which transactions are active at the time the view is created.

Percona Server often includes additional instrumentation and INFORMATION_SCHEMA (I_S) tables that are not present in standard MySQL distributions. These additions allow DBAs and developers to query internal metrics about InnoDB's state. The files here implement an INFORMATION_SCHEMA table named `XTRADB_READ_VIEW`, which exposes certain attributes of the current InnoDB read views.

### The Header File (`xtradb_i_s.h`)

Key points in the header:

- The header defines `XTRADB_I_S_H` as a guard to prevent multiple inclusions.
- It declares an external plugin variable `i_s_xtradb_read_view`. This variable represents the plugin descriptor that integrates with MySQL’s plugin infrastructure.
- By including this header elsewhere, MySQL or Percona Server recognizes that there’s an INFORMATION_SCHEMA plugin that will provide a table named `XTRADB_READ_VIEW`.

In short, this header declares the plugin so that other parts of MySQL’s codebase can find and use it.

### The Source File (`xtradb_i_s.cc`)

Key points in the source code:

1. **Licensing and Copyright:**

   - This code is under the GNU General Public License v2, and partially Copyright Percona Inc.
   - Percona often modifies and enhances InnoDB with additional features or performance improvements.

2. **Includes:**

   - Includes various MySQL/Percona and InnoDB internal headers.
   - `xtradb_i_s.h` is included, ensuring the plugin declaration matches what is defined in the header.
   - Includes `read0i_s.h` which presumably provides the `read_fill_i_s_xtradb_read_view()` function. This function is likely responsible for obtaining the read view information from InnoDB internals.

3. **Plugin Definition:**

   - Similar to other INFORMATION_SCHEMA plugins, it defines fields, initialization, and de-initialization functions for the `XTRADB_READ_VIEW` table.

4. **Table Fields:** The table `XTRADB_READ_VIEW` will have three columns:

   - `READ_VIEW_LOW_LIMIT_TRX_NUMBER`: The lower limit transaction number. It typically represents some internal transaction counter below which all transactions are either committed or rolled back.
   - `READ_VIEW_UPPER_LIMIT_TRX_ID`: The upper limit transaction ID that defines the highest ID of a transaction visible in this view.
   - `READ_VIEW_LOW_LIMIT_TRX_ID`: The low limit transaction ID below which changes are definitely committed and visible.

   These fields are described with `ST_FIELD_INFO` structures:

   ```
   cppCopy codestatic ST_FIELD_INFO xtradb_read_view_fields_info[] = {
     { "READ_VIEW_LOW_LIMIT_TRX_NUMBER", ... },
     { "READ_VIEW_UPPER_LIMIT_TRX_ID", ... },
     { "READ_VIEW_LOW_LIMIT_TRX_ID", ... },
     END_OF_ST_FIELD_INFO
   };
   ```

   Each field is typed (`MYSQL_TYPE_LONGLONG`), sized, and flagged as unsigned.

5. **Filling the Table:** The `xtradb_read_view_fill_table()` function is the core logic that the server calls when a user queries `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.XTRADB_READ_VIEW`.

   Steps:

   - It first checks permissions using `check_global_access(thd, PROCESS_ACL)`. Only users with `PROCESS` privileges can see this data.
   - Calls `read_fill_i_s_xtradb_read_view(&read_view)`. This likely calls into InnoDB code to get the current read view info.
   - If `read_fill_i_s_xtradb_read_view()` returns a null pointer, it means no data is available, and the function returns without writing rows.
   - Otherwise, it fetches the fields from `read_view` and stores them in the table’s fields.
   - Finally calls `schema_table_store_record()` to add a row to the output.

   If successful, a single row describing the current read view constraints is returned to the user.

6. **Initialization and De-initialization:**

   - `xtradb_read_view_init()` sets up the schema table fields and the pointer to the `xtradb_read_view_fill_table()` function that retrieves data.
   - `i_s_common_deinit()` does nothing special here, just returns 0.

7. **Plugin Descriptor:** The `i_s_xtradb_read_view` structure sets up this plugin so MySQL knows:

   - It’s a `MYSQL_INFORMATION_SCHEMA_PLUGIN`.
   - The `init` function (`xtradb_read_view_init`) sets fields and callbacks.
   - `deinit` is `i_s_common_deinit`.
   - Provides a name "XTRADB_READ_VIEW", an author "Percona Inc.", and a description "InnoDB Read View information".

   This descriptor is exported so that when MySQL loads plugins, it can register this INFORMATION_SCHEMA table.

### Usage

Once compiled and installed, the `XTRADB_READ_VIEW` table appears in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database. A user with appropriate privileges can run:

```
sql


Copy code
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.XTRADB_READ_VIEW;
```

This might return something like:

| READ_VIEW_LOW_LIMIT_TRX_NUMBER | READ_VIEW_UPPER_LIMIT_TRX_ID | READ_VIEW_LOW_LIMIT_TRX_ID |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 12345                          | 67890                        | 12346                      |

These values can help you understand MVCC behavior and the state of transaction IDs at the time of querying.

### Conclusion

This Percona-specific code snippet extends the MySQL INFORMATION_SCHEMA with a new table that exposes certain aspects of the InnoDB read view system. By querying `XTRADB_READ_VIEW`, DBAs can gain insights into the internal transaction versioning state of InnoDB, which can be useful for diagnostics and understanding concurrency and isolation.
