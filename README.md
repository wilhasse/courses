Since Nov 2024, I am conducting a self-study project on MySQL optimization through practical projects - including core code analysis, improving query performance, and building a system to help MySQL perform better.

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Optimizing MySQL](./db/mysql/opt/README.md) | 🚀 Umbrella Project - Comprehensive MySQL optimization initiatives |
| [PolarDBX](./db/polardbx/README.md) | 🔍 Exploring PolarDBX query optimization capabilities (caching, query splitting) in non-distributed mode |
| [Percona Code](./db/mysql/study/README.md) | 📚 Deep dive into MySQL core functionality through source code analysis |
| [InnoDB Parser](./db/mysql/parse/README.md) | 🛠️ Utility to decrypt, uncompress and parse InnoDB pages offline |
