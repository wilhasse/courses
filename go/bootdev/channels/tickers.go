/*

Complete the saveBackups function.

It should read values from the snapshotTicker and saveAfter channels simultaneously and continuously.

If a value is received from snapshotTicker, call takeSnapshot()
If a value is received from saveAfter, call saveSnapshot() and return from the function: you're done.
If neither channel has a value ready, call waitForData() and then time.Sleep() for 500 milliseconds.
After all, we want to show in the logs that the snapshot service is running.
